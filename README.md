# Bitcoin-Blockchain-based-Telecare-medical-record-Management

Remote healthcare is very necessary in current pandemic times. Telecare empowered 
remote healthcare but mostly healthcare organizations manage telehealth information in 
centralized systems which are prone to various cybercrimes like ransomware, DDOS etc. 
Privacy and security of sensitive telehealth data is essential to ensure improvement in patient 
health. Blockchain technology in integration with wearable fitness technology has potential of 
securing telehealth records due to its unique characteristics like tracking, collusion resistance, 
transaction visibility, tamperproof and provenance. The aim of this work is to develop Telecare 
medical record(TMR) management system for uploading and retrieval of real time fitness 
monitoring and medication data using blockchain technology and smart healthcare â€˜devices. 
Developed system permits healthcare providers to achieve fast access to fitness tracking data of 
patient in order to prescribe suitable medication over blockchain network. The system also 
keep track of all past TMR records that patients can access anytime in future. This system can 
prove to be a very beneficial mechanism to secure telehealth in current pandemic time. In 
designed system, unique IDs are computed for each TMR by universally unique 
identifier(UUID) and the hash generation of each TMR block is performed using secure hash 
algorithm(SHA)-256. The designed model comprises four building modules which are TMR 
uploading, TMR mining, TMR addition and TMR retrieval. All four modules of the developed 
prototype are tested and few execution outcomes are illustrated in the result section. Execution 
results shows that developed system is appropriate in TMR management for better health 
outcomes.
